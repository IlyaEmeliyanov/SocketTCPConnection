# SocketTCPConnection
This is a Python app that establishes a TCP connection with a user. Yes you can send and receive messages from and to the client,
but you can do a lot more with it.

I'll explain the main concept of this project. Basically you have 2 scripts: a server and a client.
The server is something like a gateway which different clients can connect to. The client is a user's application/game or whatever.
It can be really whatever you want.

When you run the server as a command line Python script, you'll see that a shell pops up.
Here you can write whatever command you want. You can upload files to the user's computer and download from it.
